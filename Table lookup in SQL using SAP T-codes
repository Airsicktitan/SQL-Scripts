-- There were several cases of needing to find a specific column across a large tableset
-- This utility script helps me quickly check for which tables contain a specific column
-- Left variables in place for customization as needed for situation
--You can search with tt, or without tt
--To search with tt, use TableName, to search without tt use Table_Name
